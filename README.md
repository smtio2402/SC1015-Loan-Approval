# Welcome to SC1015-Loan-Approval-And-Loan-Amount-Prediction Repository
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Loan Approval and Loan Amount Prediction from [Loan Approval DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset).

## Problem Definition
- How Can We **Effectively Predict Applicantsâ€™ Approval Rate** of Receiving a Loan?
- How Can We **Predict the Amount of Loan** that May Be Obtained by Applicants?

## Models Used
1. Univariate Decision Tree Model
2. Multivariate Decision Tree Model
3. Univariate Linear Regression Model
4. Multivariate Linear Regression Model
5. Logistic Regression Model

## Product
Our project provides applicants with clear information about their chances of approval beforehand and how much loan they can receive. This helps applicants save time and not be stuck in the process of applying for a loan. By inputting their credit score and annual income, we are able to come up with applicants' loan analysis. Our project utilises various machine learning models to increase accuracy and reliability in our outcome to applicants, enabling applicants to be informed with their loan analysis based on their current conditions and understand the necessary improvements they should make to boost their financial profile. 

## Conclusion
It is evident that credit score and annual income have a very strong correlation to loan approval rate and loan amount. This tells us that multivariate models may not always increase accuracy of data. What's crucial is finding the most influential variables that affect the targeted results, in our case, loan approval and loan amount.
